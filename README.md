# Kino Mod Documentation

This repository contains a statically generated website for documentation on how to setup the [Kino modification for CarX](https://github.com/trbflxr/kino).

This has been an effort by [locomoco28](https://github.com/locomoco28) to improve the user experience for the less tech-affine users who struggle working with `.md` documentation placed in a Github repository.
